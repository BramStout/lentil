how to setup the servers:

install build servers:
    linux:
        wget -O server-setup-unix.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zpelgrims/lentil/master/scripts/server-setup-unix.sh
        chmod 777 server-setup-unix.sh
        ./server-setup-unix.sh
    osx:
        SSH Port 22 is not enabled by default. To change the macOS Firewall configuration, please run System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall > Firewall Options on your XCLOUD instance.

    windows:
        go to github, login, download .bat script

install web server (vultr)

for each build server: remove ssh authentication between by using two ssh key:
    on web machine: ssh-keygen -t rsa
    on web machine: ssh-copy-id username@build_server_ip

    on build machine: ssh-keygen -t rsa
    on build machine: ssh-copy-id username@web_server_ip

for each build server: git repo needs to be set to use ssh to avoid password verification:
    on build server: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:zpelgrims/lentil.git
    make sure a public key is installed: 
        on build server: copy content of: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        add that to the github zpelgrims account settings
