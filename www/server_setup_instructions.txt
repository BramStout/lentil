how to setup the servers:

install build server (vultr)
install web server (vultr)

remove ssh authentication between the two ssh key:
    on web machine: ssh-keygen -t rsa
    on web machine: ssh-copy-id username@build_server_ip

    on build machine: ssh-keygen -t rsa
    on build machine: ssh-copy-id username@web_server_ip

git repo needs to be set to use ssh to avoid password verification:
    on build server: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:zpelgrims/lentil.git
    make sure a public key is installed: 
        on build server: copy content of: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        add that to the github zpelgrims account settings
